In order to make run 802_15_4:
All classes needs to be converted to match NS3 Mac
See wsn-wifi-mac.cc as an example 
The classes must implement how the configuration is done.
See what is set in beacon_enabled_star.tcl

The selection of this MAC should be done via wnswifihelper
wifi.SetStandard (WIFI_PHY_STANDARD_802154);

which creates necessary classes and connects the proper 802154 mac as it is done in wsn-regular-mac.cc

the work would be either to use these files as inspiration or port them directly

TESTS:
Make same topology in ns3 and ns2 and run, compare output.
see beacon_enabled_star.tcl for ns2
