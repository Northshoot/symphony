<h1>Wimax NetDevice<a class="headerlink" href="#wimax-netdevice" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This chapter describes the <em>ns-3</em> WimaxNetDevice and related models. By
adding WimaxNetDevice objects to <em>ns-3</em> nodes, one can create models of
802.16-based networks. Below, we list some more details about what
the <em>ns-3</em> WiMAX models cover but, in summary, the most important features
of the <em>ns-3</em> model are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a scalable and realistic physical layer and channel model</li>
<li>a packet classifier for the IP convergence sublayer</li>
<li>efficient uplink and downlink schedulers</li>
<li>support for Multicast and Broadcast Service (MBS), and</li>
<li>packet tracing functionality</li>
</ul>
<p>The source code for the WiMAX models lives in the directory
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">src/wimax</span></tt>.</p>
<p>There have been two academic papers published on this model:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>M.A. Ismail, G. Piro, L.A. Grieco, and T. Turletti, &#8220;An Improved IEEE 802.16
WiMAX Module for the NS-3 Simulator&#8221;, SIMUTools 2010 Conference, March 2010.</li>

</ul>
<div class="section" id="scope-of-the-model">
<h2>Scope of the model<a class="headerlink" href="#scope-of-the-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>From a MAC perspective, there are two basic modes of operation, that of a
Subscriber Station (SS) or a Base Station (BS). These are implemented as two
subclasses of the base class <tt class="xref cpp cpp-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">ns3::NetDevice</span></tt>, class
<tt class="xref cpp cpp-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">SubscriberStationNetDevice</span></tt> and class
<tt class="xref cpp cpp-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">BaseStationNetDevice</span></tt>. As is typical in <em>ns-3</em>, there is also a
physical layer class <tt class="xref cpp cpp-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">WimaxPhy</span></tt> and a channel class
<tt class="xref cpp cpp-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">WimaxChannel</span></tt> which serves to hold the references to all of the
attached Phy devices. The main physical layer class is the
<tt class="xref cpp cpp-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">SimpleOfdmWimaxChannel</span></tt> class.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of WiMAX is the uplink and downlink scheduler, and
there are three primary scheduler types implemented:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>SIMPLE:  a simple priority based FCFS scheduler</li>
<li>RTPS:  a real-time polling service (rtPS) scheduler</li>
<li>MBQOS:  a migration-based uplink scheduler</li>
</ul>
<p>The following additional aspects of the 802.16 specifications, as well as
physical layer and channel models, are modelled:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>leverages existing <em>ns-3</em> wireless propagation loss and delay models, as well
as <em>ns-3</em> mobility models</li>
<li>Point-to-Multipoint (PMP) mode and the WirelessMAN-OFDM PHY layer</li>
<li>Initial Ranging</li>
<li>Service Flow Initialization</li>
<li>Management Connection</li>
<li>Transport Initialization</li>
<li>UGS, rtPS, nrtPS, and BE connections</li>
</ul>
<p>The following aspects are not presently modelled but would be good topics for
future extensions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>OFDMA PHY layer</li>
<li>Link adaptation</li>
<li>Mesh topologies</li>
<li>ARQ</li>
<li>ertPS connection</li>
<li>packet header suppression</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="using-the-wimax-models">
<h2>Using the Wimax models<a class="headerlink" href="#using-the-wimax-models" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The main way that users who write simulation scripts will typically interact
with the Wimax models is through the helper API and through the publicly visible
attributes of the model.</p>
<p>The helper API is defined in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">src/wimax/helper/wimax-helper.{cc,h}</span></tt>.</p>
<p>The example <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">src/wimax/examples/wimax-simple.cc</span></tt> contains some basic code that
shows how to set up the model::</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>switch (schedType)
  {
  case 0:
    scheduler = WimaxHelper::SCHED_TYPE_SIMPLE;
    break;
  case 1:
    scheduler = WimaxHelper::SCHED_TYPE_MBQOS;
    break;
  case 2:
    scheduler = WimaxHelper::SCHED_TYPE_RTPS;
    break;
  default:
    scheduler = WimaxHelper::SCHED_TYPE_SIMPLE;
  }

NodeContainer ssNodes;
NodeContainer bsNodes;

ssNodes.Create (2);
bsNodes.Create (1);

WimaxHelper wimax;

NetDeviceContainer ssDevs, bsDevs;

ssDevs = wimax.Install (ssNodes,
                        WimaxHelper::DEVICE_TYPE_SUBSCRIBER_STATION,
                        WimaxHelper::SIMPLE_PHY_TYPE_OFDM,
                        scheduler);
bsDevs = wimax.Install (bsNodes, WimaxHelper::DEVICE_TYPE_BASE_STATION, WimaxHelper::SIMPLE_PHY_TYPE_OFDM, scheduler);</pre>
</div>
<p>This example shows that there are two subscriber stations and one base station
created. The helper method <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Install</span></tt> allows the user to specify the scheduler
type, the physical layer type, and the device type.</p>
<p>Different variants of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Install</span></tt> are available; for instance, the example
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">src/wimax/examples/wimax-multicast.cc</span></tt> shows how to specify a non-default channel
or propagation model::</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>channel = CreateObject&lt;SimpleOfdmWimaxChannel&gt; ();
channel-&gt;SetPropagationModel (SimpleOfdmWimaxChannel::COST231_PROPAGATION);
ssDevs = wimax.Install (ssNodes,
                        WimaxHelper::DEVICE_TYPE_SUBSCRIBER_STATION,
                        WimaxHelper::SIMPLE_PHY_TYPE_OFDM,
                        channel,
                        scheduler);
Ptr&lt;WimaxNetDevice&gt; dev = wimax.Install (bsNodes.Get (0),
                                         WimaxHelper::DEVICE_TYPE_BASE_STATION,
                                         WimaxHelper::SIMPLE_PHY_TYPE_OFDM,
                                         channel,
                                         scheduler);</pre>
</div>
<p>Mobility is also supported in the same way as in Wifi models; see the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">src/wimax/examples/wimax-multicast.cc</span></tt>.</p>
<p>Another important concept in WiMAX is that of a service flow. This is a
unidirectional flow of packets with a set of QoS parameters such as traffic
priority, rate, scheduling type, etc. The base station is responsible for
issuing service flow identifiers and mapping them to WiMAX connections. The
following code from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">src/wimax/examples/wimax-multicast.cc</span></tt> shows how this is
configured from a helper level::</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>ServiceFlow MulticastServiceFlow = wimax.CreateServiceFlow (ServiceFlow::SF_DIRECTION_DOWN,
                                                             ServiceFlow::SF_TYPE_UGS,
                                                             MulticastClassifier);

 bs-&gt;GetServiceFlowManager ()-&gt;AddMulticastServiceFlow (MulticastServiceFlow, WimaxPhy::MODULATION_TYPE_QPSK_12);</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wimax-attributes">
<h2>Wimax Attributes<a class="headerlink" href="#wimax-attributes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The WimaxNetDevice makes heavy use of the <em>ns-3</em> attributes subsystem for
configuration and default value management.  Presently, approximately 60 values
are stored in this system.</p>
<p>For instance, class <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ns-3::SimpleOfdmWimaxPhy</span></tt> exports these
attributes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>NoiseFigure:  Loss (dB) in the Signal-to-Noise-Ratio due to non-idealities in the receiver.</li>
<li>TxPower:  Transmission power (dB)</li>
<li>G:  The ratio of CP time to useful time</li>
<li>txGain:  Transmission gain (dB)</li>
<li>RxGain:  Reception gain (dB)</li>
<li>Nfft:  FFT size</li>
<li>TraceFilePath:  Path to the directory containing SNR to block error rate files</li>
</ul>
<p>For a full list of attributes in these models, consult the Doxygen page that
lists all attributes for <em>ns-3</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wimax-tracing">
<h2>Wimax Tracing<a class="headerlink" href="#wimax-tracing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>ns-3</em> has a sophisticated tracing infrastructure that allows users to hook into
existing trace sources, or to define and export new ones.</p>
<p>Many <em>ns-3</em> users use the built-in Pcap or Ascii tracing, and the
WimaxHelper has similar APIs::</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>AsciiTraceHelper ascii;
WimaxHelper wimax;
wimax.EnablePcap ("wimax-program", false);
wimax.EnableAsciiAll (ascii.CreateFileStream ("wimax-program.tr");</pre>
</div>
<p>Unlike other helpers, there is also a special <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">EnableAsciiForConnection()</span></tt>
method that limits the ascii tracing to a specific device and connection.</p>
<p>These helpers access the low level trace sources that exist in the WiMAX
physical layer, net device, and queue models. Like other <em>ns-3</em> trace sources,
users may hook their own functions to these trace sources if they want to do
customized things based on the packet events. See the Doxygen List of trace
sources for a complete list of these sources.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wimax-mac-model">
<h2>Wimax MAC model<a class="headerlink" href="#wimax-mac-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The 802.16 model provided in <em>ns-3</em> attempts to provide an accurate MAC and PHY
level implementation of the 802.16 specification with the Point-to-Multipoint
(PMP) mode and the WirelessMAN-OFDM PHY layer. The model is mainly composed of
three layers:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The convergence sublayer (CS)</li>
<li>The MAC CP Common Part Sublayer (MAC-CPS)</li>
<li>Physical (PHY) layer</li>
</ul>
<p>The following figure <a class="reference internal" href="#wimax-architecture"><em>WiMAX architecture</em></a> shows the relationships of these
models.</p>

<p class="caption">WiMAX architecture</p>

<div class="section" id="convergence-sublayer">
<h3>Convergence Sublayer<a class="headerlink" href="#convergence-sublayer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Convergence sublayer (CS) provided with this module implements the Packet
CS, designed to work with the packet-based protocols at higher layers. The CS is
responsible of receiving packet from the higher layer and from peer stations,
classifying packets to appropriate connections (or service flows) and processing
packets. It keeps a mapping of transport connections to service flows. This
enables the MAC CPS identifying the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters
associated to a transport connection and ensuring the QoS requirements. The CS
currently employs an IP classifier.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ip-packet-classifier">
<h3>IP Packet Classifier<a class="headerlink" href="#ip-packet-classifier" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>An IP packet classifier is used to map incoming packets to appropriate
connections based on a set of criteria. The classifier maintains a list of
mapping rules which associate an IP flow (src IP address and mask, dst IP
address and mask, src port range, dst port range and protocol) to one of the
service flows.  By analyzing the IP and the TCP/UDP headers the classifier will
append the incoming packet (from the upper layer) to the queue of the
appropriate WiMAX connection. Class <tt class="xref cpp cpp-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">IpcsClassifier</span></tt> and class
<tt class="xref cpp cpp-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">IpcsClassifierRecord</span></tt> implement the classifier module for both SS
and BS</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mac-common-part-sublayer">
<h3>MAC Common Part Sublayer<a class="headerlink" href="#mac-common-part-sublayer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The MAC Common Part Sublayer (CPS) is the main sublayer of the IEEE 802.16 MAC
and performs the fundamental functions of the MAC. The module implements the
Point-Multi-Point (PMP) mode. In PMP mode BS is responsible of managing
communication among multiple SSs. The key functionalities of the MAC CPS include
framing and addressing, generation of MAC management messages, SS initialization
and registration, service flow management, bandwidth management and scheduling
services.  Class <tt class="xref cpp cpp-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">WimaxNetDevice</span></tt> represents the MAC layer of a WiMAX
network device. This class extends the class <tt class="xref cpp cpp-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">NetDevice</span></tt> of the <em>ns-3</em>
API that provides abstraction of a network device. Class
<tt class="xref cpp cpp-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">WimaxNetDevice</span></tt> is further extended by class
<tt class="xref cpp cpp-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">BaseStationNetDevice</span></tt> and class
<tt class="xref cpp cpp-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">SubscriberStationNetDevice</span></tt>, defining MAC layers of BS and SS,
respectively.  Besides these main classes, the key functions of MAC are
distributed to several other classes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="framing-and-management-messages">
<h3>Framing and Management Messages<a class="headerlink" href="#framing-and-management-messages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The module implements a frame as a fixed duration of time, i.e., frame
boundaries are defined with respect to time. Each frame is further subdivided
into downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) subframes. The module implements the Time
Division Duplex (TDD) mode where DL and UL operate on same frequency but are
separated in time. A number of DL and UL bursts are then allocated in DL and UL
subframes, respectively. Since the standard allows sending and receiving bursts
of packets in a given DL or UL burst, the unit of transmission at the MAC layer
is a packet burst. The module implements a special PacketBurst data structure
for this purpose. A packet burst is essentially a list of packets. The BS
downlink and uplink schedulers, implemented by class <tt class="xref cpp cpp-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">BSScheduler</span></tt>
and class <tt class="xref cpp cpp-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">UplinkScheduler</span></tt>, are responsible of generating DL and UL
subframes, respectively. In the case of DL, the subframe is simulated by
transmitting consecutive bursts (instances PacketBurst). In case of UL, the
subframe is divided, with respect to time, into a number of slots. The bursts
transmitted by the SSs in these slots are then aligned to slot boundaries. The
frame is divided into integer number of symbols and Physical Slots (PS) which
helps in managing bandwidth more effectively. The number of symbols per frame
depends on the  underlying implementation of the PHY layer. The size of a DL or
UL burst is specified in units of symbols.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="network-entry-and-initialization">
<h3>Network Entry and Initialization<a class="headerlink" href="#network-entry-and-initialization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The network entry and initialization phase is basically divided into two
sub-phases, (1) scanning and synchronization and (2) initial ranging. The entire
phase is performed by the LinkManager component of SS and BS. Once an SS wants
to join the network, it first scans the downlink frequencies to search for a
suitable channel. The search is complete as soon as it detects a PHY frame. The
next step is to establish synchronization with the BS. Once SS receives a
Downlink-MAP (DL-MAP) message the synchronization phase is complete and it
remains synchronized as long as it keeps receiving DL-MAP and  Downlink Channel
Descriptor (DCD) messages. After the synchronization is established, SS waits
for a Uplink Channel Descriptor (UCD) message to acquire uplink channel
parameters. Once acquired, the first sub-phase of the network entry and
initialization is complete. Once synchronization is achieved, the SS waits for a
UL-MAP message to locate a special grant, called initial ranging interval, in
the UL subframe. This grant is allocated by the BS Uplink Scheduler at regular
intervals. Currently this interval is set to 0.5 ms, however the user is enabled
to modify its value from the simulation script.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="connections-and-addressing">
<h3>Connections and Addressing<a class="headerlink" href="#connections-and-addressing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>All communication at the MAC layer is carried in terms of connections. The
standard defines a connection as a unidirectional mapping between the SS and
BS&#8217;s MAC entities for the transmission of traffic. The standard defines two
types of connections: management connections for transmitting control messages
and transport connections for data transmission. A connection is identified by a
16-bit Connection Identifier (CID).  Class <tt class="xref cpp cpp-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">WimaxConnection</span></tt> and
class <tt class="xref cpp cpp-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Cid</span></tt> implement the connection and CID, respectively. Note that
each connection maintains its own transmission queue where packets to transmit
on that connection are queued. The ConnectionManager component of BS is
responsible of creating and managing connections for all SSs.</p>
<p>The two key management connections defined by the standard, namely the Basic and
Primary management connections, are created and allocated to the SS during the
ranging process. Basic connection plays an important role throughout the
operation of SS also because all (unicast) DL and UL grants are directed towards
SS&#8217;s Basic CID. In addition to management connections, an SS may have one or
more transport connections to send data packets. The Connection Manager
component of SS manages the connections associated to SS. As defined by the
standard, a management connection is bidirectional, i.e., a pair of downlink and
uplink connections is represented by the same CID. This feature is implemented
in a way that one connection (in DL direction) is created by the BS and upon
receiving the CID the SS then creates an identical connection (in UL direction)
with the same CID.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scheduling-services">
<h3>Scheduling Services<a class="headerlink" href="#scheduling-services" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The module supports the four scheduling services defined by the 802.16-2004
standard:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Unsolicited Grant Service (UGS)</li>
<li>Real-Time Polling Services (rtPS)</li>
<li>Non Real-Time Polling Services (nrtPS)</li>
<li>Best Effort (BE)</li>
</ul>
<p>These scheduling services behave differently with respect to how they request
bandwidth as well as how the it is granted. Each service flow is associated to
exactly one scheduling service, and the QoS parameter set associated to a
service flow actually defines the scheduling service it belongs to. When a
service flow is created the UplinkScheduler calculates necessary parameters such
as grant size and grant interval based on QoS parameters associated to it.</p>

<h3>WiMAX Uplink Scheduler Model<a class="headerlink" href="#wimax-uplink-scheduler-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Uplink Scheduler at the BS decides which of the SSs will be assigned uplink
allocations based on the QoS parameters associated to a service flow (or
scheduling service) and bandwidth requests from the SSs. Uplink scheduler
together with Bandwidth Manager implements the complete scheduling service
functionality. The standard defines up to four scheduling services (BE, UGS,
rtPS, nrtPS) for applications with different types of QoS requirements. The
service flows of these scheduling services behave differently with respect to
how they request for bandwidth as well as how the bandwidth is granted. The
module supports all four scheduling services. Each service flow is associated to
exactly one transport connection and one scheduling service. The QoS parameters
associated to a service flow actually define the scheduling service it belongs
to. Standard QoS parameters for UGS, rtPS, nrtPS and BE services, as specified
in Tables 111a to 111d of the 802.16e amendment, are supported. When a service
flow is created the uplink scheduler calculates necessary parameters such as
grant size and allocation interval based on QoS parameters associated to it.
The current WiMAX module provides three different versions of schedulers.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The first one is a simple priority-based First Come First Serve (FCFS).  For
the real-time services (UGS and rtPS) the BS then allocates grants/polls on
regular basis based on the calculated interval. For the non real-time services
(nrtPS and BE) only minimum reserved bandwidth is guaranteed if available
after servicing real-time flows. Note that not all of these parameters are
utilized by the uplink scheduler. Also note that currently only service flow
with fixed-size packet size are supported, as currently set up in simulation
scenario with OnOff application of fixed packet size. This scheduler is
implemented by class <tt class="xref cpp cpp-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">BSSchedulerSimple</span></tt> and class
<tt class="xref cpp cpp-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">UplinkSchedulerSimple</span></tt>.</li>
<li>The second one is similar to first scheduler except by rtPS service flow. All
rtPS Connections are able to transmit all packet in the queue according to the
available bandwidth. The bandwidth saturation control has been implemented to
redistribute the effective available bandwidth to all rtPS that have at least
one packet to transmit. The remaining bandwidth is allocated to nrtPS and BE
Connections. This scheduler is implemented by class
<tt class="xref cpp cpp-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">BSSchedulerRtps</span></tt> and class
<tt class="xref cpp cpp-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">UplinkSchedulerRtps</span></tt>.</li>
<li>The third one is a Migration-based Quality of Service uplink scheduler This
uplink scheduler uses three queues, the low priority queue, the intermediate
queue and the high priority queue. The scheduler serves the requests in
strict priority order from the high priority queue to the low priority queue.
The low priority queue stores the bandwidth requests of the BE service flow.
The intermediate queue holds bandwidth requests sent by rtPS and by nrtPS
connections. rtPS and nrtPS requests can migrate to the high priority queue to
guarantee that their QoS requirements are met. Besides the requests migrated
from the intermediate queue, the high priority queue stores periodic grants
and unicast request opportunities that must be scheduled in the following
frame. To guarantee the maximum delay requirement, the BS assigns a deadline
to each rtPS bandwidth request in the intermediate queue. The minimum
bandwidth requirement of both rtPS and nrtPS connections is guaranteed over a
window of duration T. This scheduler is implemented by class
<tt class="xref cpp cpp-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">UplinkSchedulerMBQoS</span></tt>.</li>

<h3>WiMAX Outbound Schedulers Model<a class="headerlink" href="#wimax-outbound-schedulers-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Besides the uplink scheduler these are the outbound schedulers at BS and SS side
(BSScheduler and SSScheduler). The outbound schedulers decide which of the
packets from the outbound queues will be transmitted in a given allocation. The
outbound scheduler at the BS schedules the downlink traffic, i.e., packets to be
transmitted to the SSs in the downlink subframe. Similarly the outbound
scheduler at a SS schedules the packet to be transmitted in the uplink
allocation assigned to that SS in the uplink subframe. All three schedulers have
been implemented to work as FCFS scheduler, as they allocate grants starting
from highest priority scheduling service to the lower priority one (UGS&gt; rtPS&gt;
nrtPS&gt; BE). The standard does not suggest any scheduling algorithm and instead
leaves this decision up to the manufacturers. Of course more sophisticated
algorithms can be added later if required.</p>

<h2>WimaxChannel and WimaxPhy models<a class="headerlink" href="#wimaxchannel-and-wimaxphy-models" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The module implements the Wireless MAN OFDM PHY specifications as the more
relevant for implementation as it is the schema chosen by the WiMAX Forum. This
specification is designed for non-light-of-sight (NLOS) including fixed and
mobile broadband wireless access. The proposed model uses a 256 FFT processor,
with 192 data subcarriers. It supports all the seven modulation and coding
schemes specified by Wireless MAN-OFDM. It is composed of two parts: the channel
model and the physical model.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="channel-model">
<h2>Channel model<a class="headerlink" href="#channel-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The channel model we propose is implemented by the class
<tt class="xref cpp cpp-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">SimpleOFDMWimaxChannel</span></tt> which extends the class
<tt class="xref cpp cpp-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">wimaxchannel</span></tt>. The channel entity has a private structure named
m_phyList which handles all the physical devices connected to it. When a
physical device sends a packet (FEC Block) to the channel, the channel handles
the packet, and then for each physical device connected to it, it calculates the
propagation delay, the path loss according to a given propagation model and
eventually forwards the packet to the receiver device.  The channel class uses
the method <cite>GetDistanceFrom()</cite> to calculate the distance between two physical
entities according to their 3D coordinates. The delay is
computed as <cite>delay = distance/C</cite>, where <cite>C</cite> is the speed of the light.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="physical-model">
<h2>Physical model<a class="headerlink" href="#physical-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The physical layer performs two main operations: (i) It receives a burst from a
channel and forwards it to the MAC layer, (ii) it receives a burst from the MAC
layer and transmits it on the channel. In order to reduce the simulation
complexity of the WiMAX physical layer, we have chosen to model offline part of
the physical layer. More specifically we have developed an OFDM simulator to
generate trace files used by the reception process to evaluate if a FEC block
can be correctly decoded or not.</p>
<p>Transmission Process: A burst is a set of WiMAX MAC PDUs. At the sending
process, a burst is converted into bit-streams and then splitted into smaller
FEC blocks which are then sent to the channel with a power equal P_tx.</p>
<p>Reception Process: The reception process includes the following operations:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Receive a FEC block from the channel.</li>
<li>Calculate the noise level.</li>
<li>Estimate the signal to noise ratio (SNR) with the following formula.</li>
<li>Determine if a FEC block can be correctly decoded.</li>
<li>Concatenate received FEC blocks to reconstruct the original burst.</li>
<li>Forward the burst to the upper layer.</li>
</ol>
<p>The developed process to evaluate if a FEC block can be correctly received or
not uses pre-generated traces.  The trace files are generated by an external
OFDM simulator (described later). A class named SNRToBlockErrorRateManager
handles a repository containing seven trace files (one for each modulation and
coding scheme). A repository is specific for a particular channel model.</p>
<p>A trace file is made of 6 columns. The first column provides the SNR value (1),
whereas the other columns give respectively the bit error rate BER (2), the
block error rate BlcER(3), the standard deviation on BlcER, and the confidence
interval (4 and 5).  These trace files are loaded into memory by the
SNRToBlockErrorRateManager entity at the beginning of the simulation.</p>
<p>Currently, The first process uses the first and third columns to determine if a
FEC block is correctly received. When the physical layer receives a packet with
an SNR equal to SNR_rx, it asks the SNRToBlockErrorRateManager to return the
corresponding block error rate BlcER. A random number RAND between 0 and 1 is
then generated. If RAND is greater than BlcER, then the block is correctly
received, otherwise the block is considered erroneous and is ignored.</p>
<p>The module provides defaults SNR to block error rate traces in default-traces.h.
The traces have been generated by an External WiMAX OFDM simulator. The
simulator is based on an external mathematics and signal processing library IT++
and includes : a random block generator, a Reed Solomon (RS) coder, a
convolutional coder, an interleaver, a 256 FFT-based OFDM modulator, a
multi-path channel simulator and an equalizer. The multipath channel is
simulated using the TDL_channel class of the IT++ library.</p>
<p>Users can configure the module to use their own traces generated by another OFDM
simulator or ideally by performing experiments in real environment. For this
purpose, a path to a repository containing trace files should be provided.  If
no repository is provided the traces form default-traces.h will be loaded. A
valid repository should contain 7 files, one for each modulation and coding
scheme.</p>
<p>The names of the files should respect the following format: modulation0.txt for
modulation 0, modulation1.txt for modulation 1 and so on...  The file format
should be as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>SNR_value1   BER  Blc_ER  STANDARD_DEVIATION  CONFIDENCE_INTERVAL1  CONFIDENCE_INTERVAL2
